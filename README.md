## 💼 Experience

- **Technology Development Intern, Advanced Microfoundry**
  - Developed a Python & C++-based program to automate preliminary checks on GDS files for fabrication requirements, transforming a previously manual process and reducing review time from hours to minutes.
  - Created a tool using Python and KLayout to identify optimal wafer separation strategies for multi-project wafers.
  - Collaborated with fabrication and design teams to embed automated validation tools into the tape-out workflow, focusing on the creation of efficient DRC scripts
 
- **Researcher, Integrated Microsystems Research Lab (Sengputa Lab), Princeton University**
  - Scripted and simulated randomly generated transformers using Cadence Virtuoso, Cadence EMX, and Python to train a model that will predict transformer geometries based on desired inputs and outputs.
  - Created a 3-layer 32-neuron multi-layer perceptron neural network using Python to predict transformer geometry based on desired inputs and outputs, achieving a 90% accuracy.
  - Wrote a Python algorithm to automate cascaded transformer-based low-noise amplifiers using the designed neural network.

- **AI Engineer, Startup**  
  - Built a LangChain Agent process (Python) with custom tools to fact check which increased accuracy from 85% to 92%.
  - Created a Python program that transcribes live video streams from any platform with punctuation and speaker identification.
  - Presented the web app to Singapore’s Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information.
  - Filed patent for the fact checking process: U.S. Patent Application No.: 19/011,265.
